Taking the Practice Test
The practice test will help you most if you take it under conditions as close as possible to those of
the actual test.
•	 Set aside 3 hours and 20 minutes of uninterrupted time
That way you can complete the entire test in one sitting. Note: The total testing time is
3 hours and 45 minutes, but you save 25 minutes because the unscored section* from this
practice test was omitted.
•	 Sit at a desk or table cleared of any other papers or books
You won’t be able to take a dictionary, books, notes, or scratch paper into the test room.
•	 Allow yourself the specified amount of time for each section
Pace yourself by using a watch (without an audible alarm), which is what you are allowed
to use on test day.
•	 Have a calculator at hand when you take the math sections
This will help you determine how much to use a calculator the day of the test. Use a
calculator with which you are familiar—preferably the same calculator you will use on test
day.
•	 Read the test instructions carefully
They are reprinted from the back cover of the test book. On test day, you will be asked to
read them before you begin answering questions.
•	 Make sure you use a No. 2 pencil
It is very important that you fill in the entire circle on the answer sheet darkly and
completely. If you change your response, erase it as completely as possible. It is very
important that you follow these instructions when filling out your answer sheet.
•	 Record your answers on paper, then score your test
Use the answer sheet when completing a practice test on paper to simulate the real testing
environment. After completing the practice test, you can score the test yourself with
“Scoring Your Test,” or you can return to collegeboard.com to enter your answers online
and receive a score report and answer explanations.

Time — 25 minutes

Turn to page 2 of your answer sheet to write your ESSAY.
The essay gives you an opportunity to show how effectively you can develop and express ideas. You should, therefore, take
care to develop your point of view, present your ideas logically and clearly, and use language precisely.
Your essay must be written on the lines provided on your answer sheet— you will receive no other paper on which to write.
You will have enough space if you write on every line, avoid wide margins, and keep your handwriting to a reasonable size.
Remember that people who are not familiar with your handwriting will read what you write. Try to write or print so that what
you are writing is legible to those readers.
Important Reminders:
• A pencil is required for the essay. An essay written in ink will receive a score of zero.
• Do not write your essay in your test book. You will receive credit only for what you write on your
answer sheet.
• An off-topic essay will receive a score of zero.
• If your essay does not reflect your original and individual work, your scores for the entire test may be canceled.
• An electronic copy of your essay will be made available to each of your designated score recipients: colleges,
universities, and scholarship programs.
You have twenty-five minutes to write an essay on the topic assigned below.

Think carefully about the issue presented in the following excerpt and the assignment below.
Nowadays nothing is private: our culture has become too confessional and self-expressive.
People think that to hide one’s thoughts or feelings is to pretend not to have those thoughts
or feelings. They assume that honesty requires one to express every inclination and impulse.
Adapted from J. David Velleman, “The Genesis of Shame”
Assignment:

Should people make more of an effort to keep some things private? Plan and write an essay in which you
develop your point of view on this issue. Support your position with reasoning and examples taken from

The passages below are followed by questions based on their content; questions following a pair of related passages may also
be based on the relationship between the paired passages. Answer the questions on the basis of what is stated or implied in the
passages and in any introductory material that may be provided.
Questions 6-9 are based on the following passages.
Passage 1
I know what your e-mail in-box looks like, and it
isn’t pretty: a babble of come-ons and lies from hucksters
and con artists. To find your real e-mail, you must wade
Line through the torrent of fraud and obscenity known politely
5 as “unsolicited bulk e-mail” and colloquially as “spam.”
In a perverse tribute to the power of the online revolution,
we are all suddenly getting the same mail: easy weight
loss, get-rich-quick schemes, etc. The crush of these messages is now numbered in billions per day. “It’s becoming
10 a major systems and engineering and network problem,”
says one e-mail expert. “Spammers are gaining control of
the Internet.”
Passage 2
Many people who hate spam assume that it is protected
as free speech. Not necessarily so. The United States
15 Supreme Court has previously ruled that individuals
may preserve a threshold of privacy. “Nothing in the
Constitution compels us to listen to or view any unwanted
communication, whatever its merit,” wrote Chief Justice
Warren Burger in a 1970 decision. “We therefore categori20 cally reject the argument that a vendor has a right to send
unwanted material into the home of another.” With regard
to a seemingly similar problem, the Telephone Consumer
Protection Act of 1991 made it illegal in the United States
to send unsolicited faxes; why not extend the act to include
25 unsolicited bulk e-mail?

6. The primary purpose of Passage 1 is to
(A)
(B)
(C)
(D)
(E)

make a comparison
dispute a hypothesis
settle a controversy
justify a distinction
highlight a concern

7. The primary purpose of Passage 2 is to
(A)
(B)
(C)
(D)
(E)

confirm a widely held belief
discuss the inadequacies of a ruling
defend a controversial technology
analyze a widespread social problem
lay the foundation for a course of action

8. What would be the most likely reaction by the author
of Passage 1 to the argument cited in lines 16-21 of
Passage 2 (“Nothing . . . another”) ?
(A) Surprise at the assumption that freedom of speech
is indispensable to democracy
(B) Dismay at the Supreme Court’s vigorous defense
of vendors’ rights
(C) Hope that the same reasoning would be applied
to all unsolicited e-mail
(D) Concern for the plight of mass marketers facing
substantial economic losses
(E) Appreciation for the political complexity of
the debate about spam
9. Unlike the author of Passage 1, the author of Passage 2
(A)
(B)
(C)
(D)
(E)

criticizes a practice
offers an example
proposes a solution
states an opinion
quotes an expert

Questions 10-16 are based on the following passage.
The following passage is adapted from a novel set in
the early twentieth century. Mr. Beebe, a clergyman, is
speaking with Cecil Vyse about a mutual acquaintance,
Lucy Honeychurch. Miss Honeychurch has recently
returned from a journey with her older cousin and
chaperone, Miss Bartlett.

“Lucy Honeychurch has no faults,” said Cecil,
with grave sincerity.
“I quite agree. At present she has none.”
“At present?”
“I’m not cynical. I’m only thinking of my pet theory
about Miss Honeychurch. Does it seem reasonable that
she should play piano so wonderfully, and live so quietly?
I suspect that someday she shall be wonderful in both.
The water-tight compartments in her will break down,
and music and life will mingle. Then we shall have her
heroically good, heroically bad —too heroic, perhaps,
to be good or bad.”
Cecil found his companion interesting.
“And at present you think her not wonderful as far
as life goes?”
“Well, I must say I’ve only seen her at Tunbridge
Wells, where she was not wonderful, and at Florence.
She wasn’t wonderful in Florence either, but I kept
on expecting that she would be.”
“In what way?”
Conversation had become agreeable to them, and
they were pacing up and down the terrace.
“I could as easily tell you what tune she’ll play next.
There was simply the sense that she found wings and
meant to use them. I can show you a beautiful picture
in my diary. Miss Honeychurch as a kite, Miss Bartlett
holding the string. Picture number two: the string breaks.”
The sketch was in his diary, but it had been made afterwards, when he viewed things artistically. At the time he
had given surreptitious tugs to the string himself.
“But the string never broke?”
“No. I mightn’t have seen Miss Honeychurch rise,
but I should certainly have heard Miss Bartlett fall.”
“It has broken now,” said the young man in low,
vibrating tones.
Immediately he realized that of all the conceited,
ludicrous, contemptible ways of announcing an engagement this was the worst. He cursed his love of metaphor;
had he suggested that he was a star and that Lucy was
soaring up to reach him?
“Broken? What do you mean?”
“I meant,” Cecil said stiffly, “that she is going
to marry me.”
The clergyman was conscious of some bitter
disappointment which he could not keep out of his
voice.

SAT Preparation Booklet

“I am sorry; I must apologize. I had no idea you
were intimate with her, or I should never have talked
in this flippant, superficial way. You ought to have
50 stopped me.” And down in the garden he saw Lucy
herself; yes, he was disappointed.
Cecil, who naturally preferred congratulations
to apologies, drew down the corner of his mouth. Was
this the reaction his action would get from the whole
55 world? Of course, he despised the world as a whole;
every thoughtful man should; it is almost a test of
refinement.
“I’m sorry I have given you a shock,” he said
dryly. “I fear that Lucy’s choice does not meet with
60 your approval.”

Calling it a cover-up would be far too dramatic. But for
more than half a century—even in the midst of some of
the greatest scientific achievements in history—physicists
have been quietly aware of a dark cloud looming on a
distant horizon. The problem is this: There are two
foundational pillars upon which modern physics rests.
One is general relativity, which provides a theoretical
framework for understanding the universe on the largest
of scales: stars, galaxies, clusters of galaxies, and beyond
to the immense expanse of the universe itself. The other
is quantum mechanics, which provides a theoretical
framework for understanding the universe on the smallest of scales: molecules, atoms, and all the way down to
subatomic particles like electrons and quarks. Through
years of research, physicists have experimentally confirmed
to almost unimaginable accuracy virtually all predictions
made by each of these theories. But these same theoretical
tools inexorably lead to another disturbing conclusion:
As they are currently formulated, general relativity and
quantum mechanics cannot both be right. The two theories
underlying the tremendous progress of physics during
the last hundred years—progress that has explained the
expansion of the heavens and the fundamental structure
of matter— are mutually incompatible.
If you have not heard previously about this ferocious
antagonism, you may be wondering why. The answer is
not hard to come by. In all but the most extreme situations,
physicists study things that are either small and light (like
atoms and their constituents) or things that are huge and
heavy (like stars and galaxies), but not both. This means
that they need use only quantum mechanics or only general
relativity and can, with a furtive glance, shrug off the barking admonition of the other. For 50 years this approach
has not been quite as blissful as ignorance, but it has been
pretty close.
But the universe can be extreme. In the central depths of
a black hole, an enormous mass is crushed to a minuscule
size. According to the big bang theory, the whole of the
universe erupted from a microscopic nugget whose size
makes a grain of sand look colossal. These are realms that
are tiny and yet incredibly massive, therefore requiring
that both quantum mechanics and general relativity simultaneously be brought to bear. The equations of general
relativity and quantum mechanics, when combined, begin
to shake, rattle, and gush with steam like a decrepit automobile. Put less figuratively, well-posed physical questions
elicit nonsensical answers from the unhappy amalgam of

56

these two theories. Even if you are willing to keep the
deep interior of a black hole and the beginning of the
universe shrouded in mystery, you can’t help feeling that
the hostility between quantum mechanics and general
relativity cries out for a deeper level of understanding.
Can it really be that the universe at its most fundamental
level is divided, requiring one set of laws when things are
large and a different, incompatible set when things are
small?
Superstring theory, a young upstart compared with the
venerable edifices of quantum mechanics and general
relativity, answers with a resounding no. Intense research
over the past decade by physicists and mathematicians
around the world has revealed that this new approach to
describing matter at its most fundamental level resolves
the tension between general relativity and quantum
mechanics. In fact, superstring theory shows more:
within this new framework, general relativity and
quantum mechanics require one another for the theory
to make sense. According to superstring theory, the
marriage of the laws of the large and the small is not
only happy but inevitable. Superstring theory has the
potential to show that all of the wondrous happenings
in the universe—from the frantic dance of subatomic
quarks to the stately waltz of orbiting binary stars—are
reflections of one grand physical principle, one master
equation.

Read the passage and select the best answers for the
questions that follow. Some questions are about particular
sentences or parts of sentences and ask you to improve

Questions 30-35 refer to the following passage.
(1) On September 10, 1973, the United States Postal
Service issued a stamp honoring Henry Ossawa Tanner
(1859-1937), one of four stamps in the American Arts
series. (2) Acclaimed as an artist in the United States and
Europe at the turn of the century, Tanner was called the
“dean” of art by W. E. B. Du Bois. (3) But after his death,
Tanner’s work was largely forgotten. (4) And so it
remained, and even later, in 1969, the donation of one of
his paintings to the Smithsonian Institution aroused new
interest in the art of this American master. (5) Now his
works are on exhibit again. (6) You can even buy posters of
his paintings!
(7) One of his most famous works is a realistic painting
by the name of “The Banjo Lesson.” (8) It was inspired by
a poem of Paul Laurence Dunbar. (9) The painting isn’t
like a photograph. (10) The magnificence of his work can
be seen with each subtle brush stroke, each carefully
crafted detail. (11) The effect is truly beautiful. (12) If I
were to try to identify the dominant theme of the painting, I
would have to say that it is family cohesiveness because the
entire scene seems to emphasize the bond between the boy
and his grandfather.

The passages below are followed by questions based on their content; questions following a pair of related passages may also
be based on the relationship between the paired passages. Answer the questions on the basis of what is stated or implied in the
passages and in any introductory material that may be provided.
Questions 9-10 are based on the following passage.
Newspaper editor and political commentator Henry
Louis Mencken was a force of nature, brushing aside
all objects animal and mineral in his headlong rush
Line to the publicity that surely awaited him. He seized
5 each day, shook it to within an inch of its life, and
then gaily went on to the next. No matter where his
writing appeared, it was quoted widely, his pungently
outspoken opinions debated hotly. Nobody else could
make so many people so angry, or make so many others
10 laugh so hard.
9. In lines 4-5, the words “seized” and “shook” help
establish which aspect of Mencken’s personality?
(A)
(B)
(C)
(D)
(E)

His code of honor

(A)
(B)
(C)
(D)
(E)

authoritative
controversial
arrogant
informal
frivolous

Questions 11-12 are based on the following passage.
The ability to see the situation as your opponents see it,
as difficult as it may be, is one of the most important skills
that you can possess as a negotiator. You must know more
Line than simply that they see things differently. It is not
5 enough to study them like beetles under a microscope;
you need to know what it feels like to be a beetle. To
accomplish this you should be prepared to withhold
judgment as you “try on” their views. Your opponents
may well believe that their views are right as strongly
10 as you believe yours are.
11. The reference to beetles in lines 5-6 serves
to suggest that
(A) people need to be more attuned to their
surroundings
(B) effective negotiation is more of a science
than an art
(C) people can be made to do what they
would prefer not to do
(D) effective negotiation requires identifying with a different viewpoint
(E) people feel uncomfortable when their
actions are under scrutiny
12. The primary purpose of the passage is to
(A) persuade people to defend their positions
on critical issues
(B) indicate a specific ability that is useful
in negotiation
(C) encourage people to be more accepting
of others
(D) argue that few people are fit for the
demands of negotiation

Passage 2

Questions 13-24 are based on the following passages.
Passage 1 is from a 2003 book that examines the famous
“I Have a Dream” speech delivered by Martin Luther
King, Jr. at the historic March on Washington in August
1963. Passage 2 is from a 2000 biography of Martin Luther
King, Jr. written by an African American scholar.

The ability of the “I Have a Dream” speech to highlight King’s early career at the expense of his later career
accounts for the tone of impatience and betrayal that often
appears when modern-day supporters of King’s agenda talk
about the speech. Former Georgia state legislator Julian
Bond said in 1986 that commemorations of King seemed to
“focus almost entirely on Martin Luther King the dreamer,
not on Martin King the antiwar activist, not on Martin King
the challenger of the economic order, not on Martin King
the opponent of apartheid, not on the complete Martin
Luther King.” One King scholar has proposed a ten-year
moratorium on reading or listening to the “I Have a Dream”
speech, in the hopes that America will then discover the
rest of King’s legacy.
This proposal effectively concedes that King’s magnificent address cannot be recovered from the misuse
and overquotation it has suffered since his death. But
it is not clear that this is so. Even now, upon hearing the
speech, one is struck by the many forms of King’s genius.
Many people can still remember the first time they heard
“I Have a Dream,” and they tend to speak of that memory
with the reverence reserved for a religious experience. At
the very least, reflecting on the “I Have a Dream” speech
should be an opportunity to be grateful for the astonishing
transformation of America that the freedom movement
wrought. In just under a decade, the civil rights movement brought down a system of segregation that stood
essentially unaltered since Reconstruction. King’s dreams
of an America free from racial discrimination are still some
distance away, but it is astounding how far the nation has
come since that hot August day in 1963. Segregation in
the South has been dismantled; there are no longer
“Whites Only” signs; segregationist governors do not
try to prevent Black children from entering public schools.
Toward the end of his life, King preached a sermon entitled
“Ingratitude,” in which he called ingratitude “one of the
greatest of all sins,” because the sinner “fail[s] to realize
his dependence on others.” The annual Martin Luther King
holiday is properly a day of national thanksgiving, a time
for the nation to recognize the immense debt it owes to
King and the thousands of heroes of the civil rights
movement for saving the soul of America.

Martin Luther King was at his best when he was
willing to reshape the wisdom of many of his intellectual predecessors. He ingeniously harnessed their ideas
to his views to advocate sweeping social change. He
believed that his early views on race failed to challenge
America fundamentally. He later confessed that he had
underestimated how deeply entrenched racism was in
America. If Black Americans could not depend on goodwill to create social change, they had to provoke social
change through bigger efforts at nonviolent direct action.
This meant that Blacks and their allies had to obtain
political power. They also had to try to restructure
American society, solving the riddles of poverty
and economic inequality.
This is not the image of King that is celebrated on
Martin Luther King Day. Many of King’s admirers are
uncomfortable with a focus on his mature beliefs. They
seek to deflect unfair attacks on King’s legacy by shrouding him in the cloth of superhuman heroism. In truth, this
shroud is little more than romantic tissue. King’s image
has often suffered a sad fate. His strengths have been
needlessly exaggerated, his weaknesses wildly overplayed. King’s true legacy has been lost to cultural
amnesia. As a nation, we have emphasized King’s
aspiration to save America through inspiring words
and sacrificial deeds. Time and again we replay the
powerful image of King standing on a national stage
in the shadow of the Lincoln Memorial mouthing perhaps the most famous four words ever uttered by a Black
American: “I have a dream.” For most Americans, those
words capture King’s unique genius. They express his
immortal longing for freedom, a longing that is familiar
to every person who dares imagine a future beyond unjust
laws and unfair customs. The edifying universality of those
four words— who hasn’t dreamed, and who cannot identify
with people whose dreams of a better world are punished
with violence?— helps to explain their durability. But those
words survive, too, because they comfort folk who would
rather entertain the dreams of unfree people than confront
their rage and despair.

(C)
(D)
(E)

contradictory
insightful
atypical
simplistic
arrogant

20. Lines 57-58 (“This is . . . Day”) mark a transition
within Passage 2 from a

(C) discussion of King’s intellectual predecessors
to an analysis of his legacy

Words have always held a particular power for me.
I remember leafing through a book of Native American
poems one morning while I was waiting for my Shakespeare
class to begin and being struck by a phrase from the preface,
“The word, the word above all, is truly magical, not only by
its meaning, but by its artful manipulation.”
This quote, which I added to my journal, reminded
me of something my grandfather had told me when I was
a girl: “If you say a word often enough it becomes your
own.” I added that phrase to my journal next to the quote
about the magic of words. When I traveled home to
Baltimore for my grandfather’s funeral a year after my
journal entry, I mentioned my grandfather’s words to my
father. He corrected me. He told me that my grandfather
had actually said, “If you say a word often enough, it
becomes you.” I was still a student at the time, but I knew
even then, even before I had made a conscious decision to
teach as well as act, that my grandfather’s words would be
important.
Actors are very impressionable people, or some would
say, suggestible people. We are trained to develop aspects
of our memories that are more emotional and sensory than
intellectual. The general public often wonders how actors
remember their lines. What’s more remarkable to me is
how actors remember, recall, and reiterate feelings and
sensations. The body has a memory just as the mind does.
The heart has a memory, just as the mind does. The act of
speech is a physical act. It is powerful enough that it can
create, with the rest of the body, a kind of cooperative
dance. That dance is a sketch of something that is inside a
person, and not fully revealed by the words alone. I came
to realize that if I were able to record part of the dance—
that is, the spoken part— and reenact it, the rest of the
body would follow. I could then create the illusion of being
another person by reenacting something she had said as she
had said it. My grandfather’s idea led me to consider that
the reenactment, or the reiteration, of a person’s words
would also teach me about that person.
I had been trained in the tradition of acting called
“psychological realism.” A basic tenet of psychological
realism is that characters live inside of you and that you
create a lifelike portrayal of the character through a process
of realizing your own similarity to the character. When I

later became a teacher of acting, I began to become more
and more troubled by the self-oriented method. I began to
look for ways to engage my students in putting themselves
in other people’s shoes. This went against the grain of the
psychological realism tradition, which was to get the character to walk in the actor’s shoes. It became less and less
interesting intellectually to bring the dramatic literature of
the world into a classroom of people in their late teens and
twenties, and to explore it within the framework of their
real lives. Aesthetically it seemed limited, because most
of the time the characters all sounded the same. Most characters spoke somewhere inside the rhythmic range of the
students. More troubling was that this method left an
important bridge out of acting. The spirit of acting is the
travel from the self to the other. This “self-based” method
seemed to come to a spiritual halt. It saw the self as the
ultimate home of the character. To me, the search for character is constantly in motion. It is a quest that moves back
and forth between the self and the other.
I needed evidence that you could find a character’s psychological reality by “inhabiting” that character’s words. I
needed evidence of the limitations of basing a character on
a series of metaphors from an actor’s real life. I wanted to
develop an alternative to the self-based technique, a technique that would begin with the other and come to the self,
a technique that would empower the other to find the actor
rather than the other way around.

Scoring the Essay
Essays are scored in a manner that is fair and consistent,
using a holistic approach. In holistic scoring, a piece of
writing is considered as a total work, the whole of which is
greater than the sum of its parts. Essays are scored by experienced high school teachers and college faculty members.
The majority of essay readers teach English, composition,
or language arts courses. Each essay is scored independently
by two readers on a scale of 1 to 6, with 6 being the highest
score. The combined score for both readers will range from
2 to 12. If the two readers’ scores are more than one point
apart, a third reader resolves the discrepancy.
In scoring the essays, readers follow the scoring guide below.

The scoring guide describes the features typically found in
essays at each score point, including critical thinking, development, organization, language use, and sentence structure.
A student can get a top score on the essay even with minor
errors in grammar, usage, and mechanics. The SAT essay
neither rewards nor penalizes formulaic approaches to writing, such as the five-paragraph essay.
There is no formula for effective writing, no single best
way to communicate an idea. Any essay that features clear
lines of reasoning, appropriate choices of evidence, ample
development of ideas, effective organization, and precise
use of language will receive a high score, regardless of style
or approach. Readers are trained to recognize and reward a
wide variety of essays at each score point.

Essay #1: This essay received a score of 6
Americans nowadays are far too concerned with their privacy. In our culture of large houses, home security
systems, and private counslers, everyone is trying too hard to seclude themselves and cut off their emotions
with the outside world. Two summers ago some friends of mine and I went on a trip to Thailand for one month.
In Thailand I observed how communicative Thais were with all of their problems and emotions, and I became
convinced that this culture of sharing one’s emotions was far superior to the American way of hiding them.
In America we all are individualists, meaning we all care about standing out in a crowd and making a unique,
strong impression. So when my friends and I arrived in a small village in the North of Thailand, we were
somewhat shocked to find that Thais centered around groups, not individual people. When it came to emotions,
if someone had a problem, the group had a problem, and everyone would try and fix it. It was as if the entire
village was one large team that had a mission to help all of its individuals. No one was left in isolation.
In contrast, we Americans hid all of our stressful or other serious emotions. We were concerned once again
with our appearance, how we would be judged by our friends, and whether or not it suited our unique identity.
For us, it was “every man for himself.” If someone had a problem, it was up to them to fix it. The advantages of
this might be that everyone learns to solve their problems on their own, but people are then not learning how to
communicate their problems, they are not learning how to communicate in a group.
For example, my friend Duncan had recently got refused by a college he had had his heart set on, and he was
feeling depressed about it. While in Thailand we all asumed that he was doing ok because he never talked about
it. After one month however, all of us in the group had grown closer together and we started to share our feelings
more. Duncan confessed to us that he was still upset about his college refusal, and we all worked together
to cheer him up and get rid of his depression. There was nothing “weak” about him feeling upset. In fact, he
showed us strength by being brave enough to express himself to us.
Should people keep their emotions private? If they have serious emotions that they hold inside of themselves,
most likely these emotions will be a lot harder to make go away. Thai culture, and the Thai way of solving
problems as a group, convinced me that people are meant to express themselves in a group. Confessing one’s
emotions to others is a way to cope with problems, and it teaches us valuable lessons of communication and
honesty. People need to confess their problems, not keep them private.

Why Essay #1 Received a Score of 6
This essay demonstrates outstanding critical thinking in effectively and insightfully developing a point of
view on the issue (“Confessing one’s emotions to others is a way to cope with problems, and it teaches us
valuable lessons of communication and honesty”) with a clearly appropriate example from personal experience.
Well organized and clearly focused, the essay uses an account of a trip to Thailand to illustrate the point that
Americans, who “all care about standing out in a crowd” and thus conceal “all of our stressful or other serious
emotions,” “need to learn the Thai way of solving problems…people are meant to express themselves in
a group.” The essay demonstrates smooth progression of ideas (“Duncan confessed to us that he was still
upset about his college refusal, and we all worked together to cheer him up…There was nothing ‘weak’ about
him feeling upset. In fact, he showed his strength by being brave enough to express himself to us”) and uses
language skillfully throughout. This essay demonstrates clear and consistent mastery and earns the top score
of 6.

Essay #2: This essay received a score of 6
I cannot help but believe, despite my slight ambivalence over the issue of privacy, that the trends which now-adays indicate a slight reluctance on part of people to keep some things private, are dangerous. Shows like “Jerry
Springer” in the USA tend to reveal information that is inherently dangerous for young children, and thus should
be kept private.
A problem with capitalism that I have become cognizant of, through my observations, is that if some activity can
help amass profits, it is widely employed. This almost insane drive to attain profit maximization not only ignores
external and societal costs, but is setting dangerous cultural precedents. Since lurid, sensationalist confessions
by ‘average’ people are quite appealing to the general television viewer, it is unsurprising that myriad shows have
propped up on television, which pander to these very wants by exposing stories and information which is better
kept dissembled.
In this context, the show ‘Jerry Springer’ epitomizes my argument. In this show, an array of family problems
are presented to an audience, not for information dissemination, but for ‘entertainment’; In this case, which
means—and I think this is quite obvious—nothing but mockery and amusement over the antics of people who
choose to expose their problems. These ‘personal predicaments’ range from some less disturbing ones, such as
people cheating on their friends or marital partners, to extremely grave ones, such as people sleeping with their
relatives.
I am not someone who would like to contravene principles like freedom of expression, or freedom of choice.
But democracy as a system doesnot herald absolute freedom for its own sake; rather, it champions the cause
of ‘live and let live’. The latter principal is surely being violated by people who choose to expose such stories—
for no plausible reasons I can conjure, since no family problem has actually been solved by such shows—to
impressionable young children; for TV ratings and parental supervision do not always work.
Am I exaggerating? Is it not harmful or psychologically detrimental when a child is exposed to such ideas? You be
the judge.

Why Essay #2 Received a Score of 6
This essay demonstrates clear and consistent mastery, effectively and insightfully developing a point of view
on the issue (“the trends which now-a-days indicate a slight reluctance on part of people to keep some things
private, are dangerous”) with clearly appropriate reasons and examples. The essay displays outstanding critical
thinking in linking the “harmful or psychologically detrimental” behavior publicized on the “Jerry Springer”
television show with capitalism’s “almost insane drive to attain profit maximization.” The essay is well organized
and clearly focused, demonstrating smooth progression of ideas (“I am not someone who would like to
contravene principles like freedom of expression, or freedom of choice. But democracy as a system doesnot

also exhibits skillful use of language, featuring precision and variety in vocabulary and sentence structure. This
outstanding essay receives the top score of 6.

Essay #3: This essay received a score of 5
People no longer respect the privacy of others or of themselves. This is evident through the exposure of famous
peoples’ lives, the “showing off” of possessions and sex appeal, and pornography. Society should learn to
respect the privacy of others despite the urge to get involved.
One of the most common places privacy is violated is among famous or upper class groups. The reason society
feels a need to know everything that goes on in a famous person’s life is because of jealousy. People constantly
remind the rich and the famous that their lives are not “perfect.” For instance, when Brittany Speare’s married
her limosine driver and then divorced him eight hours later, everyone read it in the tabloids, newspapers, saw
it on the television and heard of it on the radio. Another reason why such people are constant victims of over
exposure is because the media takes advantage of certain situations in order to increase their ratings and profit.
A popular practice, especially found in the United States and European countries, is the “showing” off of
possessions. People want the world to know that they have money and own an Escalade or Rolls Royce. MTV
has a show called CRIBS, which shows the audience the interior and exterior of rich multi-million dollar homes
of famous musical artists. Also, the “showing” off of bodies and the use of sex appeal has become almost a
necessity in the fashion business. Women and men completely expose their bodies in an effort to make money
and become famous. This has a negative effect on society because it leads to a decline in self confidence and
people, especially young teen girls, in an attempt to look like super models, starve themselves.
Pornography is another aspect of life that should be private. Sex is a sacred act that is shared between a man and
a woman yet people, such as Paris Hilton, have violated and abused it. This brings the idea that sex sells.
Society should not overexpose their bodies, money, or the private lives of others. This could help decrease the
amount of crimes, teen pregnancies, and identity theft.

Why Essay #3 Received a Score of 5
This essay effectively develops a point of view on the issue (“Society should not expose their bodies, money,
or the private lives of others”) with appropriate reasons and examples. The well-organized essay uses strong
critical thinking to explain how people are hurt by the lack of privacy in today’s image-focused, media-saturated
society (“Women and men completely expose their bodies in an effort to make money and become famous. This
has a negative effect on society because it leads to a decline in self confidence and people, especially young
teen girls, in an attempt to look like super models, starve themselves”). The essay exhibits facility in the use of
language (“People no longer respect the privacy of others or of themselves. This is evident through the exposure
of famous peoples’ lives, the “showing off” of possessions and sex appeal, and pornography”). To earn a score
of 6, the writer needs to use stronger critical thinking to explain more fully how celebrity overexposure and
pornography are harmful to society.
This essay demonstrates reasonably consistent mastery and earns a 5.

Essay #4: This essay received a score of 5
For a person to be honest, he need not share every aspect of his life. It is not dishonest to not mention a fact that
was not inquired about. Even if it was asked of, one can easily say, truthfully, that they care not to speak of the
issue. People in our modern society should make an effort to keep aspects of their lives private, for it would give
them and others many problems, most of which are much greater than dishonesty could ever be.
Many issues are personnal, and relevant only to you. There is no reason why personnal information should be
shared, unless it is by the will of that person, or in order to solve a larger problem. In the United States, we have
our government separated from our religious institutions, and for good reason. People should be allowed to
worship however they choose, and the rest of the world should have no effect on it, as guaranteed in the Bill of
Rights. However, this is not always the case. In the Nazi-controlled Europe of WWII, Jews were forced to wear
a Star of David on their arm to show they were Jewish and therefore were shunned. Their right to privacy was
violated, and should not have been.
In the world today, there are many diverse cultures. The United States, for example, has races from all over the
globe. Many people have opinions about some of these different races and the beliefs that correlate. Groups
such as the KKK outwardly show their opinions of other ethnic groups, in many cases violently. For the safety of
themselves and the ones they shun, they should keep their opinions private. Even on the smaller scale, if two
people were to divulge all their opinions and beliefs to the other, they would no doubt find many ideas upon
which they disagree. Instead of ignoring their minute differences and getting along well, they chose, by not
keeping their ideas private, to bring them out and possibly argue heatedly about them.
There are many more instances in which privacy should be honored, but these two should give an adequate idea
of why privacy is very important to a peaceful society.

Why Essay #4 Received a Score of 5
This essay demonstrates strong critical thinking in developing a point of view on the issue (“privacy is very
important to a peaceful society”) with appropriate reasons and examples. Well organized and focused around
the idea that privacy helps people avoid “many problems, most of which are much greater than dishonesty,” the
essay displays coherence and progression of ideas, first citing the violation of Jews’ privacy under the Nazis,
then explaining that in today’s world of diverse cultures, little good comes of people “divulg[ing] all their opinions
and beliefs.” The essay exhibits facility in the use of language and demonstrates variety in sentence structure
(“Groups such as the KKK outwardly show their opinions of other ethnic groups, in many cases violently. For the
safety of themselves and the ones they shun, they should keep their opinions private”). To achieve a score of 6,
the writer needs to explain the link between the two examples more insightfully. The essay is effective and earns
a score of 5.

Essay #5: This essay received a score of 4
J. David Velleman had an idea that many may believe as truth, however, when looking at the entire picture it is
clear that in all free countries everyone has a right to keep things to themselves. In our very own constitution
we have dedicated the 4th Amendment to protecting people from incriminating themselves in the court of
law. People every day do things and refuse to tell others about their actions. If a person truely wants to keep
something private then that person has the right to do so. Our culture becoming a far too confessional and selfexpressive is not a true statement in that people have and will always have the ability to keep something private
if they want to.
Our culture in America is growing closer to utilizing therapy as a tool to improve their state of mind and well
being. This, however, requires a person to be more open so that a trained professional can use their skills to help
solve problems. However, at the begining of the 1st therapy session the therapist is required to tell the person
or group that they do not need to share something if they dont wish to. This then gives the choice to the patient
who decide what to tell and what not to tell.
In the past some might say that people were forced into saying things more than in our present day culture. The
Spanish Inquisition tortured their victims and forced them to say things even if it wasnt true in order to sentance
the person to death. It is an obvious choice that therapy is a far better way of opening a person up.

Why Essay #5 Received a Score of 4
This essay develops a point of view on the issue (“If a person truely wants to keep something private then
that person has the right to do so”) with reasons and examples that adequately support the position, thus
demonstrating competent critical thinking. Generally focused around the idea that people in contemporary
America enjoy the right to privacy, a right that people have not always possessed, the essay features some
coherence and progression of ideas (“In the past some might say that people were forced into saying things
more than in our present day culture. The Spanish Inquisition tortured their victims and forced them to say things
even if it wasnt true in order to sentance the person to death. It is an obvious choice that therapy is a far better
way of opening a person up”). The essay exhibits adequate facility in the use of language despite some errors. To
earn a higher score, the writer should further develop the interesting contrast between therapy and the Spanish
Inquisition with additional focused reasoning and other evidence. This competent essay receives a score of 4.

Essay #6: This essay received a score of 4
People should have a choice whether they want to keep their own matters private, and the public should respect
people’s decisions. If people want to keep their matters private, they should not have to make an effort.
An example of “confessional and self-expressive” matters is a diary. Many people express their deepest
thoughts and feelings in diaries and journals. Some people, such as celebrities, choose to publicize their diaries.
If such is their desire, no one should have a problem. Some celebrities just want average people to know what a
famous is actually like. These inside peeks can be entertaining and informative.
On the other hand, if people choose to keep their diaries secret, then others should respect them. People can
use diaries to disclose embarrassing, revealing secrets that would otherwise eat away at them. People can use
their diaries as an escape. Others should not violate their privacy for no reason.
Of course, sometimes people do have a good reason for invading someone’s privacy and reading his/her diary.
Because people often think that no one who matters will ever read their diaries, they can reveal their innermost
thoughts. These diaries can be important to historians. For example, Anne Frank’s powerfully moving diary
revealed a great deal about life during the Holocaust. Her diary has proven to be an excellent primary source.
Another important diary is Go Ask Alice. Alice’s diary opens up the world of drugs. Her story can be used to help
other drug-addicted teens or to prevent people from trying drugs. Thus, opening up diaries to the public can be
very useful.
Clearly, there are benefits to keeping certain things private or public.

Why Essay #6 Received a Score of 4
This essay demonstrates competent critical thinking in developing a point of view on the issue (“Clearly, there are benefits to keeping certain things private or public”) through a generally focused discussion of diaries. The essay uses adequate reasons and examples to examine both sides of the privacy debate (“If people want to keep their matters private,
they should not have to make an effort….Of course, sometimes people do have a good reason for invading someone’s
privacy and reading his/her diary”). The essay demonstrates some progression of ideas and exhibits adequate facility in
the use of language (“These diaries can be important to historians. For example, Anne Frank’s powerfully moving diary
revealed a great deal about life during the Holocaust. Her diary has proven to be an excellent primary source”). To achieve
a higher score, the writer should use critical thinking to reconcile the opposing sides of the issue, perhaps by answering the question, “when, exactly, is it acceptable to read someone else’s diary?” The essay is competent and receives a
score of 4.

Essay #7: This essay received a score of 3
I think that you should not have to keep everything private. People have a lot of views, ideas, stories, etc. and if
they feel that it is necessary to tell them, then let them. I think that if it is helpful, necessary, or comforting to the
person talking or talking to, then anyone should be able to talk about it.
My first example is if someone was having a problem. If this person is feeling really bad and their friend (peer)
wants to tell them how they feel about the topic, then keeping it private is the wrong thing to do! The feelings
that the second person is expressing to the first could be extremely helpful.
My second example is that some people solve their own problems by talking about it. Often times when
someone is having some kind of problem, speaking out and letting people know how they feel can help them.
Just hearing themselves talk about it can really help a person. This doesn’t mean that you have to physically talk
about it to another human. As long as you aren’t screaming at someone that you don’t know, then let it go.
My last example is if you knew something or had an opinion on something that could greatly help you or
someone else from doing something that is physically or mentally damaging. For example suicide. No one wants
you to keep your feelings in if it is going to be something dangerous like this.
I think that if it is helpful, necesarry or comforting to the person talking or talking to, then anyone should be able
to say what you feel.

Why Essay #7 Received a Score of 3
This essay demonstrates some critical thinking in developing a point of view on the issue (“I think that if it is
helpful, necessary, or comforting to the person talking or talking to, then anyone should be able to talk about it”)
with reasons or examples. However, the evidence provided is limited in focus and is inadequately developed
to support the position (“My last example is if you knew someone or had an opinion on something that could
greatly help you or someone else from doing something that is physically or mentally damaging. For example
suicide. No one wants you to keep your feelings in if it is going to be something dangerous like this”). The essay
also displays developing facility in the use of language. To attain a higher score, the writer should improve the
focus of the evidence provided, perhaps by including examples of actual situations in which “speaking out” was
beneficial. This essay demonstrates developing mastery and earns a 3.

Essay #8: This essay received a score of 2
I feel that people should keep things more private, but some things should be expressed. People should keep
things more quiet, because thats how rumors get out, when people talk about something they don’t really
know about well. If people kept quiet then rumors wouldn’t get started, and as long as they kept quiet, it gives
them more time to learn the truth. If things were kept in private, maybe there would not be wars and terrorism.
People would get along and not have to argue over dumb stuff. Most bad things happen because someone says
something wrong. In that case if people kept their opinions private, there wouldn’t be anything spoken wrong.
I also think somethings should be expressed, like if there was something bad going to happen to the country,
people would speak about it, instead of keeping it quiet. Some others that shouldn’t be kept quiet would be
deaths, so people could hear if they knew the person or not. Basically any thing important to the country and
families should not be kept private. The only way it should is if they wanted it too.
Overall, I feel that you can say what you want, but make sure you are speaking the truth and if not keep it private.

Why Essay #8 Received a Score of 2
This essay develops a vague point of view on the issue (“I feel that people should keep things more private,
but some things should be expressed”) and provides insufficient evidence to support the position, thus
demonstrating weak critical thinking. The essay is poorly focused, displaying serious problems with progression
of ideas and the use of language (“Some others that shouldn’t be kept quiet would be deaths, so people could
hear if they knew the person or not. Basically any thing important to the country and families should not be kept
private. The only way it should is if they wanted it too”). To earn a higher score, the writer should offer adequate,
developed reasons and examples that clarify the distinction between what should be expressed and what should
be kept private. This essay is seriously limited and receives a score of 2.

Essay #9: This essay received a score of 1
In life people’s privacy are viewed on different levels. It depends on how serious their secret is. If it is very
serious they will do anything to keep it private if not they will tell in time.
Our culture has been viewed by all and in the opinions of the world i guess, some think it needs to be like it is,
too where we know what’s going on in the world. Others don’t want to know but when they do find out it freaks
them out, to were their paranoid.
Our cultures privacy is our opinion. It should in some ways be kept a serious secret and they should take
more effort to keep it private. If not that serious it will be told in time, just like when Bush went to Iraq for
Thanksgiving.

Why Essay #9 Received a Score of 1
This essay develops no viable point of view on the issue, offering only disjointed, unfocused statements about
privacy (“Our cultures privacy is our opinion. It should in some ways be kept a serious secret and they should
take more effort to keep it private”). The essay displays severe flaws in sentence structure (“If it is very serious
they will do anything to keep it private if not they will tell in time”) and contains pervasive errors in grammar,
usage, and mechanics that interfere with meaning (“when they do find out it freaks them out, to were their
paranoid”). To achieve a higher score, the writer needs to present a clear point of view and support it with
relevant reasons and examples. This essay demonstrates no mastery and receives a score of 1.
