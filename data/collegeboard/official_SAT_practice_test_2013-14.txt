Taking the Practice Test

The practice test will help you most if you take it under conditions as close as possible to
those of the actual test.
•

Set aside 3 hours and 20 minutes of uninterrupted time
That way you can complete the entire test in one sitting. Note: The total testing
time is 3 hours and 45 minutes, but you save 25 minutes because the unscored
section* from this practice test was omitted.

•

Sit at a desk or table cleared of any other papers or books
You won’t be able to take a dictionary, books, notes, or scratch paper into the test
room.

•

Allow yourself the specified amount of time for each section
Pace yourself by using a watch (without an audible alarm), which is what you are
allowed to use on test day.

•

Have a calculator at hand when you take the math sections
This will help you determine how much to use a calculator the day of the test. Use a
calculator with which you are familiar------preferably the same calculator you will use
on test day.

•

Read the test instructions carefully
They are reprinted from the back cover of the test book. On test day, you will be
asked to read them before you begin answering questions.

•

Make sure you use a No. 2 pencil
It is very important that you fill in the entire circle on the answer sheet darkly and
completely. If you change your response, erase it as completely as possible. It is
very important that you follow these instructions when filling out your answer
sheet.

•

Record your answers on paper, then score your test
Use the answer sheet when completing a practice test on paper to simulate the real
testing environment. After completing the practice test, you can score the test
yourself with ‘‘Scoring Your Test,’’ or you can return to collegeboard.com

	

	

	

	

ESSAY
Time — 25 minutes

Turn to page 2 of your answer sheet to write your ESSAY.
The essay gives you an opportunity to show how effectively you can develop and express ideas. You should, therefore, take
care to develop your point of view, present your ideas logically and clearly, and use language precisely.
Your essay must be written on the lines provided on your answer sheet— you will receive no other paper on which to write.
You will have enough space if you write on every line, avoid wide margins, and keep your handwriting to a reasonable size.
Remember that people who are not familiar with your handwriting will read what you write. Try to write or print so that what
you are writing is legible to those readers.
Important Reminders:
• A pencil is required for the essay. An essay written in ink will receive a score of zero.
• Do not write your essay in your test book. You will receive credit only for what you write on your
answer sheet.
• An off-topic essay will receive a score of zero.
• If your essay does not reflect your original and individual work, your scores for the entire test may be canceled.
• An electronic copy of your essay will be made available to each of your designated score recipients: colleges,
universities, and scholarship programs.
You have twenty-five minutes to write an essay on the topic assigned below.

Think carefully about the issue presented in the following excerpt and the assignment below.
A colleague of the great scientist James Watson remarked that Watson was always “lounging
around, arguing about problems instead of doing experiments.” He concluded that “There is
more than one way of doing good science.” It was Watson’s form of idleness, the scientist
went on to say, that allowed him to solve “the greatest of all biological problems: the discovery
of the structure of DNA.” It is a point worth remembering in a society overly concerned with
efficiency.
Adapted from John C. Polanyi, “Understanding Discovery”
Assignment:

Do people accomplish more when they are allowed to do things in their own way? Plan and write an essay
in which you develop your point of view on this issue. Support your position with reasoning and examples
taken from your reading, studies, experience, or observations.

Passage 1

Food has always been considered one of the most salient
markers of cultural traditions. When I was a small child,
food was the only thing that helped identify my family as
Filipino American. We ate pansit lug-lug (a noodle dish)
and my father put patis (salty fish sauce) on everything.
However, even this connection lessened as I grew older.
As my parents became more acculturated, we ate less
typically Filipino food. When I was twelve, my mother
took cooking classes and learned to make French and
Italian dishes. When I was in high school, we ate chicken
marsala and shrimp fra diablo more often than Filipino
dishes like pansit lug-lug.
Passage 2

Jean Anthelme Brillat-Savarin— who in 1825 confidently announced, “Tell me what you eat, and I will tell
you who you are”— would have no trouble describing
cultural identities of the United States. Our food reveals
us as tolerant adventurers who do not feel constrained
by tradition. We “play with our food” far more readily
than we preserve the culinary rules of our varied ancestors.
Americans have no single national cuisine. What unites
American eaters culturally is how we eat, not what we
eat. As eaters, Americans mingle the culinary traditions
of many regions and cultures. We are multiethnic eaters.
9. Which of the following statements best captures
the relationship between the two passages?
(A) Passage 1 notes problems for which Passage 2
proposes solutions.
(B) Passage 1 presents claims that are debunked
by Passage 2.
(C) Passage 2 furnishes a larger context for
the experiences described in Passage 1.
(D) Passage 2 provides an update of the situation
depicted in Passage 1.
(E) Passage 2 uses material presented in Passage 1
to correct a popular misconception.

10. The author of Passage 2 would most likely regard
the mother’s willingness to “make French and
Italian dishes” (lines 9-10, Passage 1) as
(A)
(B)
(C)
(D)
(E)

laughably pretentious
understandably conservative
typically American
a regrettable compromise
a surprising attitude

11. The two passages differ in their discussions of food
primarily in that Passage 1
(A) considers specific dishes eaten by particular
people, whereas Passage 2 comments on
a culture’s general attitude toward eating

Passage 2 offers a historical analysis of
consumption

preferences, whereas Passage 2 rejects
that approach as overly sentimental

whereas Passage 2 underscores those
that are more unusual

Generations of science-fiction movies have conditioned
us to consider bug-eyed monsters, large-brained intellectual
humanoids, and other rather sophisticated extraterrestrial
creatures as typical examples of life outside Earth. The
reality, however, is that finding any kind of life at all, even
something as simple as bacteria, would be one of the most
exciting discoveries ever made.
The consensus within the scientific community seems to
be that we eventually will find not only life in other parts of
the galaxy but also intelligent and technologically advanced
life. I have to say that I disagree. While I believe we will
find other forms of life in other solar systems (if not in
our own), I also feel it is extremely unlikely that a large
number of advanced technological civilizations are out
there, waiting to be discovered. The most succinct support
for my view comes from Nobel laureate physicist
Enrico Fermi, the man who ran the first nuclear reaction
ever controlled by human beings. Confronted at a 1950
luncheon with scientific arguments for the ubiquity of
technologically advanced civilizations, he supposedly
said, “So where is everybody?”
This so-called Fermi Paradox embodies a simple logic.
Human beings have had modern science only a few hundred years, and already we have moved into space. It is not
hard to imagine that in a few hundred more years we will
be a starfaring people, colonizing other systems. Fermi’s
argument maintains that it is extremely unlikely that many
other civilizations discovered science at exactly the same
time we did. Had they acquired science even a thousand
years earlier than we, they now could be so much more
advanced that they would already be colonizing our solar
system.
If, on the other hand, they are a thousand years behind
us, we will likely arrive at their home planet before they
even begin sending us radio signals. Technological
advances build upon each other, increasing technological
abilities faster than most people anticipate. Imagine, for
example, how astounded even a great seventeenth-century
scientist like Isaac Newton would be by our current global
communication system, were he alive today. Where are
those highly developed extraterrestrial civilizations so dear
to the hearts of science-fiction writers? Their existence is
far from a foregone conclusion.

Although posed in the most casual of circumstances,
the Fermi Paradox has reverberated through the decades
and has at times threatened to destroy the credibility
of those scientists seriously engaged in the Search for
Extraterrestrial Intelligence (SETI) research program.
One possible answer to Fermi’s question (“If there are
extraterrestrials, where are they?”) is that extraterrestrials
have in fact often visited Earth, and continue to do so.
This is the answer of those who believe in the existence
of unidentified flying objects, or UFO’s. But few scientists, even those engaged in SETI, take the UFO claims
seriously. “You won’t find anyone around here who
believes in UFO’s,” says Frank Drake, a well-known
SETI scientist. If one discounts the UFO claims, yet still
believes that there are many technological civilizations in
the galaxy, why have they not visited us? Drake’s answer
is straightforward: “High-speed interstellar travel is so
demanding of resources and so hazardous that intelligent
civilizations don’t attempt it.” And why should they
attempt it, when radio communication can supply all
the information they might want?
At first glance, Drake’s argument seems very persuasive. The distances between stars are truly immense.
To get from Earth to the nearest star and back, traveling
at 99 percent of the speed of light, would take 8 years.
And SETI researchers have shown that, to accelerate
a spacecraft to such a speed, to bring it to a stop, and
to repeat the process in the reverse direction, would
take almost unimaginable amounts of energy.
Astronomer Ben Zuckerman challenges Drake’s
notion that technological beings would be satisfied with
radio communication. “Drake’s implicit assumption is
that the only thing we’re going to care about is intelligent life. But what if we have an interest in simpler
life-forms? If you turn the picture around and you have
some advanced extraterrestrials looking at the Earth, until
the last hundred years there was no evidence of intelligent
life but for billions of years before that they could have
deduced that this was a very unusual world and that there
were probably living creatures on it. They would have had
billions of years to come investigate.” Zuckerman contends
that the reason extraterrestrials haven’t visited us is that so
few exist.

13. Which statement about the Fermi Paradox is supported
by both passages?
(A) It articulates a crucial question for those interested
in the existence of extraterrestrials.
(B) It clarifies the astronomical conditions required
to sustain life on other planets.
(C) It reveals the limitations of traditional ideas
about the pace of technological change.
(D) It demonstrates the scientific community’s
fascination with the concept of interstellar
travel.
(E) It suggests that advanced extraterrestrial
civilizations may be uninterested in our
culture.
14. Which statement best describes a significant difference
between the two passages?
(A) Passage 1 analyzes a literary form, while
Passage 2 argues that literature has little
bearing on science.

surveys current opinion in a debate.
(C) Passage 1 concludes by rejecting the Fermi
Paradox, while Passage 2 opens by
embracing it.
(D) Passage 1 describes a phenomenon, while
Passage 2 details a belief system that would
reject such a phenomenon.
(E) Passage 1 defends a viewpoint, while Passage 2
questions that viewpoint’s place in scientific
research.
15. The author of Passage 1 mentions “monsters,”
“humanoids,” and “creatures” (lines 2-4)
primarily to
(A) question the literary value of science fiction
(B) contrast fictional notions with a scientific
perspective
(C) offer examples of the human fear of the unknown

17. Passage 1 suggests that the Fermi Paradox depends
most directly on which assumption?
(A) Extraterrestrial civilizations may not wish to be
discovered by human beings.
(B) Extraterrestrial civilizations would most likely
have discovered technology at about the same
time human beings discovered it.
(C) Extraterrestrial technology would develop at
roughly the same rate as human technology.
(D) Extraterrestrial civilizations would inevitably
use technology for aggressive ends.
(E) Science is a more powerful form of human
knowledge than are art and literature.
18. The claim made in Passage 1 that a “consensus”
exists (lines 8-11) would most likely be interpreted
by the author of Passage 2 as
(A) evidence of compromise in the scientific
community
(B) an attack on SETI researchers
(C) support for Fermi’s analysis
(D) a revelation of an unexpected truth
(E) an oversimplification of a complex debate

(lines 37-40) in order to
(A) emphasize the rapid rate of technological
innovation
(B) acknowledge the impact of a profound thinker
(C) criticize the inflexibility of Newton’s
contemporaries
(D) speculate about Newton’s influence on current
research
(E) highlight the value of scientific curiosity

as was colonization on Earth.
(C) We would do better to study indigenous life-forms
rather than search for extraterrestrial creatures.
(D) Humans would be wise to consider that they

Directions: The following passage is an early draft of an
essay. Some parts of the passage need to be rewritten.
Read the passage and select the best answers for the
questions that follow. Some questions are about particular
sentences or parts of sentences and ask you to improve
sentence structure or word choice. Other questions ask you
to consider organization and development. In choosing
answers, follow the requirements of standard written
English.

Questions 30-35 are based on the following passage.
(1) No one owns Antarctica. (2) The nations of
the world agreed— some of them reluctantly— that all
countries would share the continent for the purposes of
scientific research. (3) Governed by the Antarctic Treaty,
written in 1959 and adopted in 1961, which has been
signed by 27 countries. (4) Another 17 countries have
agreed to abide by the treaty in order to participate in
research being done in Antarctica.
(5) In Antarctica, relations among the researchers and
their countries are both simpler and more complicated than
in the rest of the world. (6) Relations are simpler because
each country has only a few scientists on this isolated
continent. (7) Treaty clauses assure that the research there
is nonmilitary. (8) On the other hand, when conflicts do
arise, there is no clear process for dealing with them.
(9) Decisions that can make or break the preservation
of Antarctica’s unique environment and its scientific
opportunities depend on a political system designed to
have nobody in command.
(10) Clear decision making has become a more urgent
challenge as more tourists are attracted to Antarctica.
(11) Scientists living on Antarctica were not always as
careful to preserve the pristine environment as they are
now. (12) Tour operators are working with treaty members
to devise regulations, and there are plans to assess the
environmental impacts of tours. (13) But regulations
and assessment plans may prove difficult to settle on
and enforce in a place where jurisdiction is unclear.
30. What must be done to sentence 3 ?

Questions 6-7 are based on the following passage.

Questions 8-9 are based on the following passage.

“Mechanical pencils rule,” my fifteen-year-old
grandniece, Genevieve, declared when I invited her to
be her generation’s voice on school supplies. “Nobody
sharpens anymore.” Then, continuing with a fashion
maven’s hyperbole and arbitrary imperatives, she gave
a passionate disquisition on types of clickers, new grips,
smaller lead sizes, and other niceties of pencil selection.
As she consigned the yellow-painted wooden pencil to
the wastebasket of history, I felt a rush of nostalgia for
the perfumed sharpener shavings of my youth.

Black holes are the most efficient engines of destruction
known to humanity. Their intense gravity is a one-way
ticket to oblivion, and material spiraling into them can
heat up to millions of degrees and glow brightly. Yet, they
are not all-powerful. Even supermassive black holes are
minuscule by cosmic standards. They typically account for
less than one percent of their galaxy’s mass. Accordingly,
astronomers long assumed that supermassive holes, let
alone their smaller cousins, would have little effect beyond
their immediate neighborhoods. So it has come as a surprise over the past decade that black hole activity is closely
intertwined with star formation occurring farther out in the
galaxy.

6. In lines 4-5, the author refers to a “fashion maven’s”
tone primarily in order to
(A) imply that Genevieve has only a superficial
appreciation of mechanical pencils
(B) suggest that Genevieve is excessively concerned
about her clothing
(C) illustrate some of the exaggerated claims made
by mechanical pencil manufacturers
(D) emphasize the unpredictability of trends in consumer tastes
(E) indicate that Genevieve expresses her opinions
with authority and flair

in lines 10-13 (“So it . . . galaxy”) ?
(A) It summarizes the points made in the first
four lines of the passage.
(B) It provides support for the argument asserted
in the preceding statement.
(C) It introduces a new view of information
presented earlier in the passage.
(D) It challenges recent scientific findings.
(E) It offers examples to support a theory.
9. Which of the following most resembles the relationship
between “black hole activity” and “star formation”
(lines 11-12) as described in the passage?
(A) A volcanic eruption on one continent results
in higher rainfall totals on another continent.
(B) Industrial emissions in one region lead to an
increase in airborne pollutants in adjacent
regions.
(C) A drought in a wilderness area causes a
significant loss of vegetation in that area.

in higher gas prices in oil-dependent countries.

the population of smaller aquatic organisms.

Georgia was to be married. It was the week before
Christmas, and on the last day of the year she would
become Mrs. Joseph Tank. She had told Joe that if
they were to be married at all they might as well get it
over with this year, and still there was no need of being
married any earlier in the year than was necessary. She
assured him that she married him simply because she was
tired of having paper bags waved before her eyes everywhere she went and she thought if she were once officially
associated with him people would not flaunt his idiosyncrasies at her that way. And then Ernestine, her best friend,
approved of getting married, and Ernestine’s ideas were
usually good. To all of which Joe responded that she
certainly had a splendid head to figure it out that way.
Joe said that to his mind reasons for doing things weren’t
very important anyhow; it was doing them that counted.
Yesterday had been her last day on the paper. She had
felt queer about that thing of taking her last assignment,
though it was hard to reach just the proper state, for the
last story related to pork-packers, and pork-packing is
not a setting favorable to sentimental regrets. It was just
like the newspaper business not even to allow one a little
sentimental harrowing over one’s exodus from it. But the
time for gentle melancholy came later on when she was
sorting her things at her desk just before leaving, and
was wondering what girl would have that old desk— if
they cared to risk another girl, and whether the other poor
girl would slave through the years she should have been
frivolous, only to have some man step in at the end and
induce her to surrender the things she had gained through
sacrifice and toil.
As she wrote a final letter on her typewriter— she did
hate letting the old machine go— Georgia did considerable
philosophizing about the irony of working for things only
to the end of giving them up. She had waded through snowdrifts and been drenched in pouring rains, she had been
frozen with the cold and prostrated with the heat, she had
been blown about by Chicago wind until it was strange
there was any of her left in one piece, she had had front
doors— yes, and back doors too— slammed in her face,
she had been the butt of the alleged wit of menials and
hirelings, she had been patronized by vapid women as
the poor girl who must make her living some way, she
had been roasted by—but never mind— she had had
a beat* or two! And now she was to wind it all up by
marrying Joseph Tank, who had made a great deal of

50

money out of the manufacture of paper bags. This from
her—who had always believed she would end her days
in New York, or perhaps write a realistic novel exposing
some mighty evil!

Ridiculing television, and warning about its inherent
evils, is nothing new. It has been that way since the
medium was invented, and television hasn’t exactly
been lavished with respect as the decades have passed.
I suspect, though, that a lot of the fear and loathing
directed at television comes out of a time-honored,
reflexive overreaction to the dominant medium of the
moment. For the past several decades, television has
been blamed for corrupting our youth and exciting
our adults, distorting reality, and basically being a
big, perhaps dangerous, waste of time. Before TV,
radio and film were accused of the same things. And
long before that— in fact, some 2,500 years earlier —
philosophers were arguing that poetry and drama
should be excluded from any ideal city on much the
same grounds.
In Book 10 of the Republic, Plato (428-348 B.C.)
attacks epic poet Homer (c. 850 B.C.) and the tragedians on several grounds, all of which have a familiar
ring. “Their productions are appearances and not realities,”
he gripes. “Drawing, and in fact all imitation . . . [is] quite
removed from the truth.” The audience, as well as the art
form, troubled Plato, whose remarks are colored by an
implied disdain for the popularity of public performances.
The “common people,” as Plato so charitably calls them,
are drawn to “peevish and diverse” characters— such as
Odysseus and other heroes in the Iliad and the Odyssey—
who (to Plato, anyway) engage in such questionable
displays of emotion as “spinning out a long melancholy
lamentation” or “disfiguring themselves in grief.” To
Plato, baring such intimate sorrows is not to be condoned.
(Clearly, he would have given thumbs down to the central
characters of Shakespeare’s Hamlet and Macbeth.) “If you
receive the pleasure-seasoned Muse1 of song and epic,”
Plato warns, “pleasure and pain will be kings in your city,
instead of law.” Finally, Plato sums up his anti-arts argument with the cold, sweeping pronouncement that “poetry
is not to be taken seriously.”
One academic who has studied and written extensively
about both Plato and television suggests that Plato, rather
than being anti-arts, was merely an elitist. Plato wanted
to ban poetry readings and live theater, the argument
goes, because, being free and accessible and raucous and
extremely popular, they were the mass entertainment
of that era. “If, instead of ‘tragedy’ and ‘poetry,’ and
‘Homer’ and ‘Aeschylus,’2 you read ‘mass entertainment’
or ‘popular media,’ you’ll recognize Plato’s arguments as
the ancestor of all the reasons we have today for being
suspicious of television.”
To wit: poetry, by which Plato means drama, confuses
us between appearance and reality. The action it presents

55

60

is too extreme and violent. Most important, it’s a corrupting influence, perverting its audience by bombarding it
with inferior characters and vulgar subjects— and constituting, in Plato’s own words, “a harm to the mind of
its audience.”
If Plato’s Republic had become reality, it would have
been a republic with a lot of empty libraries, theaters, and
museums—if, indeed, those repositories of the arts would
have survived at all. Plato’s personal utopia never came to
pass— but throughout the centuries, wherever and whenever a new medium of artistic expression attracted a lot
of people, someone has been ready, waiting, and eager to
attack its content and fear its impact.

An understanding of any national literature depends
very much on an awareness of the larger cultural context.
Without some knowledge of language, of history, of
inflection, of the position of the storyteller within the
group, without a hint of the social roles played by males
and females in the culture, without a sense of the society’s
humor or priorities —without such knowledge, how can
we, as reader or listener, penetrate to the core of meaning
in an expression of art?
The difficulty of gaining access to the literature of a
different culture may be illustrated by an exemplary folktale (in translation) from the Tanaina (Athabaskan) culture
of south-central Alaska. It would typically be told to a
general audience within the society, including the full range
of ages from young children to grandparents; it would be
recounted with gesticulation and exaggeration by a performance specialist. It would be expected to have different
meanings to the various categories of listeners— instructive,
entertaining, reinforcing, or all three. Here is a brief version
of the story:
“Once upon a time there was a porcupine woman who
decided to do some hunting on the far side of the river. She
went to the bank, where she met a beaver.
‘Hello,’ she said to him. ‘I need to do some hunting over
there. Will you ride me across on your back?’
‘I’d be glad to,’ replied the beaver. ‘Hop on.’
So the porcupine woman climbed on his back, and he
started swimming for the other side. When he had almost
made it, the porcupine woman said, ‘Oh my! I’ve forgotten
to bring my sack. I’ll need to go back to the other bank and
get it.’
‘All right,’ said the beaver, and swam back. He was
panting while the porcupine woman went to get her sack.
‘Okay,’ she said. ‘Let’s go.’ So they started across
again. The beaver was swimming much more slowly. When
they had practically reached the other side, she said, ‘Oh
my! I’ve forgotten to bring my needle. We’ll have to go
back and get it.’
This time the beaver didn’t say anything— he didn’t
have enough breath! But he turned around and pulled them
back to the shore and nearly passed out while she got her
needle.

‘Hurry up, now,’ the porcupine woman said as she
climbed back on his back. He could hardly keep his nose
above water, but he had almost made it to the far bank
again when she said, ‘Oh my! I’ve forgotten my staff.
We’ll have to . . . .’
Before she had finished her sentence the beaver had
flipped over in the water and dragged himself onto the
bank, where he lay half dead. The porcupine woman
managed to make the shore too, and climbed up onto a bear
path. When she had caught her breath, she turned on the
beaver and quilled him to death.”
The Tanaina live in an environment that could euphemistically be described as “difficult.” Survival, especially
in the wild, is always precarious. Further, they were, in the
precontact period, a nonliterate people. Oral communication was therefore the method of cultural transmission,
legal understanding, and meaningful communication. It is
also necessary to know that a “staff,” as mentioned in the
story, functions as both a walking stick and a weapon, and
that in the Tanaina symbol system, porcupines were
supposed to be rather ponderous, dull-witted creatures, and
beavers were thought to be energetic and industrious but
overly spontaneous and erratic.
For the reader armed with these data, the story becomes
more accessible as a lesson in contract law, with several
additional minor themes. A culturally attuned listener
would notice, for instance, that when the porcupine woman
proposed passage to the beaver, he agreed without any
stipulations or clarifications of the terms. He gave a
basically open-ended agreement—made a contract— and
hence the porcupine woman was perfectly within her rights
both in demanding that he return three times and in quilling
him to death when he reneged.
The story is not, however, without its moral for the porcupine women of this world. Her stated aim is to go
hunting, and yet she sets out without the three essentials of
that endeavor: a sack in which to carry home her game, a
needle with which to sew up the intestines, and, most
important, an implement with which to hunt and defend
herself. True, she had an open-ended contract, but where
does she wind up at the conclusion of the story? Sitting,
exhausted, quills used up, weaponless, and not only on the
wrong side of the river from her home but on a bear path!
The hunter is about to become the hunted, and all because
of her own improvidence.
