Taking the Practice Test

The practice test will help you most if you take it under conditions as close as possible to
those of the actual test.
‚Ä¢

Set aside 3 hours and 20 minutes of uninterrupted time
That way you can complete the entire test in one sitting. Note: The total testing
time is 3 hours and 45 minutes, but you save 25 minutes because the unscored
section* from this practice test was omitted.

‚Ä¢

Sit at a desk or table cleared of any other papers or books
You won‚Äôt be able to take a dictionary, books, notes, or scratch paper into the test
room.

‚Ä¢

Allow yourself the specified amount of time for each section
Pace yourself by using a watch (without an audible alarm), which is what you are
allowed to use on test day.

‚Ä¢

Have a calculator at hand when you take the math sections
This will help you determine how much to use a calculator the day of the test. Use a
calculator with which you are familiar------preferably the same calculator you will use
on test day.

‚Ä¢

Read the test instructions carefully
They are reprinted from the back cover of the test book. On test day, you will be
asked to read them before you begin answering questions.

‚Ä¢

Make sure you use a No. 2 pencil
It is very important that you fill in the entire circle on the answer sheet darkly and
completely. If you change your response, erase it as completely as possible. It is
very important that you follow these instructions when filling out your answer
sheet.

‚Ä¢

Record your answers on paper, then score your test
Use the answer sheet when completing a practice test on paper to simulate the real
testing environment. After completing the practice test, you can score the test
yourself with ‚Äò‚ÄòScoring Your Test,‚Äô‚Äô or you can return to collegeboard.com

Think carefully about the issue presented in the following excerpt and the assignment below.
Nowadays nothing is private: our culture has become too confessional and self-expressive.
People think that to hide one‚Äôs thoughts or feelings is to pretend not to have those thoughts
or feelings. They assume that honesty requires one to express every inclination and impulse.
Adapted from J. David Velleman, ‚ÄúThe Genesis of Shame‚Äù

The passages below are followed by questions based on their content; questions following a pair of related passages may also
be based on the relationship between the paired passages. Answer the questions on the basis of what is stated or implied in the
passages and in any introductory material that may be provided.
Questions 6-9 are based on the following passages.
Passage 1
I know what your e-mail in-box looks like, and it
isn‚Äôt pretty: a babble of come-ons and lies from hucksters
and con artists. To find your real e-mail, you must wade
Line through the torrent of fraud and obscenity known politely
5 as ‚Äúunsolicited bulk e-mail‚Äù and colloquially as ‚Äúspam.‚Äù
In a perverse tribute to the power of the online revolution,
we are all suddenly getting the same mail: easy weight
loss, get-rich-quick schemes, etc. The crush of these messages is now numbered in billions per day. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs becoming
10 a major systems and engineering and network problem,‚Äù
says one e-mail expert. ‚ÄúSpammers are gaining control of
the Internet.‚Äù
Passage 2
Many people who hate spam assume that it is protected
as free speech. Not necessarily so. The United States
15 Supreme Court has previously ruled that individuals
may preserve a threshold of privacy. ‚ÄúNothing in the
Constitution compels us to listen to or view any unwanted
communication, whatever its merit,‚Äù wrote Chief Justice
Warren Burger in a 1970 decision. ‚ÄúWe therefore categori20 cally reject the argument that a vendor has a right to send
unwanted material into the home of another.‚Äù With regard
to a seemingly similar problem, the Telephone Consumer
Protection Act of 1991 made it illegal in the United States
to send unsolicited faxes; why not extend the act to include
25 unsolicited bulk e-mail?

6. The primary purpose of Passage 1 is to
(A)
(B)
(C)
(D)
(E)

make a comparison
dispute a hypothesis
settle a controversy
justify a distinction
highlight a concern

7. The primary purpose of Passage 2 is to
(A)
(B)
(C)
(D)
(E)

confirm a widely held belief
discuss the inadequacies of a ruling
defend a controversial technology
analyze a widespread social problem
lay the foundation for a course of action

8. What would be the most likely reaction by the author
of Passage 1 to the argument cited in lines 16-21 of
Passage 2 (‚ÄúNothing . . . another‚Äù) ?
(A) Surprise at the assumption that freedom of speech
is indispensable to democracy
(B) Dismay at the Supreme Court‚Äôs vigorous defense
of vendors‚Äô rights
(C) Hope that the same reasoning would be applied
to all unsolicited e-mail
(D) Concern for the plight of mass marketers facing
substantial economic losses
(E) Appreciation for the political complexity of
the debate about spam
9. Unlike the author of Passage 1, the author of Passage 2
(A)
(B)
(C)
(D)
(E)

criticizes a practice
offers an example
proposes a solution
states an opinion
quotes an expert

Questions 10-16 are based on the following passage.
The following passage is adapted from a novel set in
the early twentieth century. Mr. Beebe, a clergyman, is
speaking with Cecil Vyse about a mutual acquaintance,
Lucy Honeychurch. Miss Honeychurch has recently
returned from a journey with her older cousin and
chaperone, Miss Bartlett.

‚ÄúLucy Honeychurch has no faults,‚Äù said Cecil,
with grave sincerity.
‚ÄúI quite agree. At present she has none.‚Äù
‚ÄúAt present?‚Äù
‚ÄúI‚Äôm not cynical. I‚Äôm only thinking of my pet theory
about Miss Honeychurch. Does it seem reasonable that
she should play piano so wonderfully, and live so quietly?
I suspect that someday she shall be wonderful in both.
The water-tight compartments in her will break down,
and music and life will mingle. Then we shall have her
heroically good, heroically bad ‚Äîtoo heroic, perhaps,
to be good or bad.‚Äù
Cecil found his companion interesting.
‚ÄúAnd at present you think her not wonderful as far
as life goes?‚Äù
‚ÄúWell, I must say I‚Äôve only seen her at Tunbridge
Wells, where she was not wonderful, and at Florence.
She wasn‚Äôt wonderful in Florence either, but I kept
on expecting that she would be.‚Äù
‚ÄúIn what way?‚Äù
Conversation had become agreeable to them, and
they were pacing up and down the terrace.
‚ÄúI could as easily tell you what tune she‚Äôll play next.
There was simply the sense that she found wings and
meant to use them. I can show you a beautiful picture
in my diary. Miss Honeychurch as a kite, Miss Bartlett
holding the string. Picture number two: the string breaks.‚Äù
The sketch was in his diary, but it had been made afterwards, when he viewed things artistically. At the time he
had given surreptitious tugs to the string himself.
‚ÄúBut the string never broke?‚Äù
‚ÄúNo. I mightn‚Äôt have seen Miss Honeychurch rise,
but I should certainly have heard Miss Bartlett fall.‚Äù
‚ÄúIt has broken now,‚Äù said the young man in low,
vibrating tones.
Immediately he realized that of all the conceited,
ludicrous, contemptible ways of announcing an engagement this was the worst. He cursed his love of metaphor;
had he suggested that he was a star and that Lucy was
soaring up to reach him?
‚ÄúBroken? What do you mean?‚Äù
‚ÄúI meant,‚Äù Cecil said stiffly, ‚Äúthat she is going
to marry me.‚Äù
The clergyman was conscious of some bitter
disappointment which he could not keep out of his
voice.

42 Getting Ready for the SAT

‚ÄúI am sorry; I must apologize. I had no idea you
were intimate with her, or I should never have talked
in this flippant, superficial way. You ought to have
50 stopped me.‚Äù And down in the garden he saw Lucy
herself; yes, he was disappointed.
Cecil, who naturally preferred congratulations
to apologies, drew down the corner of his mouth. Was
this the reaction his action would get from the whole
55 world? Of course, he despised the world as a whole;
every thoughtful man should; it is almost a test of
refinement.
‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry I have given you a shock,‚Äù he said
dryly. ‚ÄúI fear that Lucy‚Äôs choice does not meet with
60 your approval.‚Äù

Calling it a cover-up would be far too dramatic. But for
more than half a century‚Äîeven in the midst of some of
the greatest scientific achievements in history‚Äîphysicists
have been quietly aware of a dark cloud looming on a
distant horizon. The problem is this: There are two
foundational pillars upon which modern physics rests.
One is general relativity, which provides a theoretical
framework for understanding the universe on the largest
of scales: stars, galaxies, clusters of galaxies, and beyond
to the immense expanse of the universe itself. The other
is quantum mechanics, which provides a theoretical
framework for understanding the universe on the smallest of scales: molecules, atoms, and all the way down to
subatomic particles like electrons and quarks. Through
years of research, physicists have experimentally confirmed
to almost unimaginable accuracy virtually all predictions
made by each of these theories. But these same theoretical
tools inexorably lead to another disturbing conclusion:
As they are currently formulated, general relativity and
quantum mechanics cannot both be right. The two theories
underlying the tremendous progress of physics during
the last hundred years‚Äîprogress that has explained the
expansion of the heavens and the fundamental structure
of matter‚Äî are mutually incompatible.
If you have not heard previously about this ferocious
antagonism, you may be wondering why. The answer is
not hard to come by. In all but the most extreme situations,
physicists study things that are either small and light (like
atoms and their constituents) or things that are huge and
heavy (like stars and galaxies), but not both. This means
that they need use only quantum mechanics or only general
relativity and can, with a furtive glance, shrug off the barking admonition of the other. For 50 years this approach
has not been quite as blissful as ignorance, but it has been
pretty close.
But the universe can be extreme. In the central depths of
a black hole, an enormous mass is crushed to a minuscule
size. According to the big bang theory, the whole of the
universe erupted from a microscopic nugget whose size
makes a grain of sand look colossal. These are realms that
are tiny and yet incredibly massive, therefore requiring
that both quantum mechanics and general relativity simultaneously be brought to bear. The equations of general
relativity and quantum mechanics, when combined, begin
to shake, rattle, and gush with steam like a decrepit automobile. Put less figuratively, well-posed physical questions
elicit nonsensical answers from the unhappy amalgam of

50

these two theories. Even if you are willing to keep the
deep interior of a black hole and the beginning of the
universe shrouded in mystery, you can‚Äôt help feeling that
the hostility between quantum mechanics and general
relativity cries out for a deeper level of understanding.
Can it really be that the universe at its most fundamental
level is divided, requiring one set of laws when things are
large and a different, incompatible set when things are
small?
Superstring theory, a young upstart compared with the
venerable edifices of quantum mechanics and general
relativity, answers with a resounding no. Intense research
over the past decade by physicists and mathematicians
around the world has revealed that this new approach to
describing matter at its most fundamental level resolves
the tension between general relativity and quantum
mechanics. In fact, superstring theory shows more:
within this new framework, general relativity and
quantum mechanics require one another for the theory
to make sense. According to superstring theory, the
marriage of the laws of the large and the small is not
only happy but inevitable. Superstring theory has the
potential to show that all of the wondrous happenings
in the universe‚Äîfrom the frantic dance of subatomic
quarks to the stately waltz of orbiting binary stars‚Äîare
reflections of one grand physical principle, one master
equation.

Questions 30-35 refer to the following passage.
(1) On September 10, 1973, the United States Postal
Service issued a stamp honoring Henry Ossawa Tanner
(1859-1937), one of four stamps in the American Arts
series. (2) Acclaimed as an artist in the United States and
Europe at the turn of the century, Tanner was called the
‚Äúdean‚Äù of art by W. E. B. Du Bois. (3) But after his death,
Tanner‚Äôs work was largely forgotten. (4) And so it
remained, and even later, in 1969, the donation of one of
his paintings to the Smithsonian Institution aroused new
interest in the art of this American master. (5) Now his
works are on exhibit again. (6) You can even buy posters of
his paintings!
(7) One of his most famous works is a realistic painting
by the name of ‚ÄúThe Banjo Lesson.‚Äù (8) It was inspired by

like a photograph. (10) The magnificence of his work can
be seen with each subtle brush stroke, each carefully
crafted detail. (11) The effect is truly beautiful. (12) If I
were to try to identify the dominant theme of the painting, I
would have to say that it is family cohesiveness because the
entire scene seems to emphasize the bond between the boy
and his grandfather.

The passages below are followed by questions based on their content; questions following a pair of related passages may also
be based on the relationship between the paired passages. Answer the questions on the basis of what is stated or implied in the
passages and in any introductory material that may be provided.
Questions 9-10 are based on the following passage.
Newspaper editor and political commentator Henry
Louis Mencken was a force of nature, brushing aside
all objects animal and mineral in his headlong rush
Line to the publicity that surely awaited him. He seized
5 each day, shook it to within an inch of its life, and
then gaily went on to the next. No matter where his
writing appeared, it was quoted widely, his pungently
outspoken opinions debated hotly. Nobody else could
make so many people so angry, or make so many others
10 laugh so hard.
9. In lines 4-5, the words ‚Äúseized‚Äù and ‚Äúshook‚Äù help
establish which aspect of Mencken‚Äôs personality?
(A)
(B)
(C)
(D)
(E)

His code of honor
His sense of humor
His vindictiveness
His intensity

strongly suggests that Mencken‚Äôs writings were
(A)
(B)
(C)
(D)
(E)

authoritative
controversial
arrogant
informal

Questions 11-12 are based on the following passage.
The ability to see the situation as your opponents see it,
as difficult as it may be, is one of the most important skills
that you can possess as a negotiator. You must know more
Line than simply that they see things differently. It is not
5 enough to study them like beetles under a microscope;
you need to know what it feels like to be a beetle. To
accomplish this you should be prepared to withhold
judgment as you ‚Äútry on‚Äù their views. Your opponents
may well believe that their views are right as strongly
10 as you believe yours are.
11. The reference to beetles in lines 5-6 serves
to suggest that
(A) people need to be more attuned to their
surroundings
(B) effective negotiation is more of a science
than an art
(C) people can be made to do what they
would prefer not to do
(D) effective negotiation requires identifying with a different viewpoint
(E) people feel uncomfortable when their
actions are under scrutiny
12. The primary purpose of the passage is to
(A) persuade people to defend their positions
on critical issues
(B) indicate a specific ability that is useful
in negotiation
(C) encourage people to be more accepting
of others
(D) argue that few people are fit for the
demands of negotiation
(E) suggest that negotiators should always
seek consensus

Questions 13-24 are based on the following passages.
Passage 1 is from a 2003 book that examines the famous
‚ÄúI Have a Dream‚Äù speech delivered by Martin Luther
King, Jr. at the historic March on Washington in August
1963. Passage 2 is from a 2000 biography of Martin Luther
King, Jr. written by an African American scholar.

The ability of the ‚ÄúI Have a Dream‚Äù speech to highlight King‚Äôs early career at the expense of his later career
accounts for the tone of impatience and betrayal that often
appears when modern-day supporters of King‚Äôs agenda talk
about the speech. Former Georgia state legislator Julian
Bond said in 1986 that commemorations of King seemed to
‚Äúfocus almost entirely on Martin Luther King the dreamer,
not on Martin King the antiwar activist, not on Martin King
the challenger of the economic order, not on Martin King
the opponent of apartheid, not on the complete Martin
Luther King.‚Äù One King scholar has proposed a ten-year
moratorium on reading or listening to the ‚ÄúI Have a Dream‚Äù
speech, in the hopes that America will then discover the
rest of King‚Äôs legacy.
This proposal effectively concedes that King‚Äôs magnificent address cannot be recovered from the misuse
and overquotation it has suffered since his death. But
it is not clear that this is so. Even now, upon hearing the
speech, one is struck by the many forms of King‚Äôs genius.
Many people can still remember the first time they heard
‚ÄúI Have a Dream,‚Äù and they tend to speak of that memory
with the reverence reserved for a religious experience. At
the very least, reflecting on the ‚ÄúI Have a Dream‚Äù speech
should be an opportunity to be grateful for the astonishing
transformation of America that the freedom movement
wrought. In just under a decade, the civil rights movement brought down a system of segregation that stood
essentially unaltered since Reconstruction. King‚Äôs dreams
of an America free from racial discrimination are still some
distance away, but it is astounding how far the nation has
come since that hot August day in 1963. Segregation in
the South has been dismantled; there are no longer
‚ÄúWhites Only‚Äù signs; segregationist governors do not
try to prevent Black children from entering public schools.
Toward the end of his life, King preached a sermon entitled
‚ÄúIngratitude,‚Äù in which he called ingratitude ‚Äúone of the
greatest of all sins,‚Äù because the sinner ‚Äúfail[s] to realize
his dependence on others.‚Äù The annual Martin Luther King
holiday is properly a day of national thanksgiving, a time
for the nation to recognize the immense debt it owes to
King and the thousands of heroes of the civil rights
movement for saving the soul of America.

Martin Luther King was at his best when he was
willing to reshape the wisdom of many of his intellectual predecessors. He ingeniously harnessed their ideas
to his views to advocate sweeping social change. He
believed that his early views on race failed to challenge
America fundamentally. He later confessed that he had
underestimated how deeply entrenched racism was in
America. If Black Americans could not depend on goodwill to create social change, they had to provoke social
change through bigger efforts at nonviolent direct action.
This meant that Blacks and their allies had to obtain
political power. They also had to try to restructure
American society, solving the riddles of poverty
and economic inequality.
This is not the image of King that is celebrated on
Martin Luther King Day. Many of King‚Äôs admirers are
uncomfortable with a focus on his mature beliefs. They
seek to deflect unfair attacks on King‚Äôs legacy by shrouding him in the cloth of superhuman heroism. In truth, this
shroud is little more than romantic tissue. King‚Äôs image
has often suffered a sad fate. His strengths have been
needlessly exaggerated, his weaknesses wildly overplayed. King‚Äôs true legacy has been lost to cultural
amnesia. As a nation, we have emphasized King‚Äôs
aspiration to save America through inspiring words
and sacrificial deeds. Time and again we replay the
powerful image of King standing on a national stage
in the shadow of the Lincoln Memorial mouthing perhaps the most famous four words ever uttered by a Black
American: ‚ÄúI have a dream.‚Äù For most Americans, those
words capture King‚Äôs unique genius. They express his
immortal longing for freedom, a longing that is familiar
to every person who dares imagine a future beyond unjust
laws and unfair customs. The edifying universality of those
four words‚Äî who hasn‚Äôt dreamed, and who cannot identify
with people whose dreams of a better world are punished
with violence?‚Äî helps to explain their durability. But those
words survive, too, because they comfort folk who would
rather entertain the dreams of unfree people than confront
their rage and despair.

illustrate an important trait that King possessed
question King‚Äôs ability to empathize with others

the view of King expressed in lines 38-42 of Passage 1
(‚ÄúThe annual . . . America‚Äù) as
(A)
(B)
(C)
(D)
(E)

contradictory
insightful
atypical
simplistic
arrogant

20. Lines 57-58 (‚ÄúThis is . . . Day‚Äù) mark a transition
within Passage 2 from a
(A) consideration of King‚Äôs views to a critique
of people‚Äôs understanding of them
(B) challenge to King‚Äôs beliefs to an acceptance

(C) discussion of King‚Äôs intellectual predecessors
to an analysis of his legacy
(D) celebration of King‚Äôs strengths to an examination of his weaknesses

Words have always held a particular power for me.
I remember leafing through a book of Native American
poems one morning while I was waiting for my Shakespeare
class to begin and being struck by a phrase from the preface,
‚ÄúThe word, the word above all, is truly magical, not only by
its meaning, but by its artful manipulation.‚Äù
This quote, which I added to my journal, reminded
me of something my grandfather had told me when I was
a girl: ‚ÄúIf you say a word often enough it becomes your
own.‚Äù I added that phrase to my journal next to the quote
about the magic of words. When I traveled home to
Baltimore for my grandfather‚Äôs funeral a year after my
journal entry, I mentioned my grandfather‚Äôs words to my
father. He corrected me. He told me that my grandfather
had actually said, ‚ÄúIf you say a word often enough, it
becomes you.‚Äù I was still a student at the time, but I knew
even then, even before I had made a conscious decision to
teach as well as act, that my grandfather‚Äôs words would be
important.
Actors are very impressionable people, or some would
say, suggestible people. We are trained to develop aspects
of our memories that are more emotional and sensory than
intellectual. The general public often wonders how actors
remember their lines. What‚Äôs more remarkable to me is
how actors remember, recall, and reiterate feelings and
sensations. The body has a memory just as the mind does.
The heart has a memory, just as the mind does. The act of
speech is a physical act. It is powerful enough that it can
create, with the rest of the body, a kind of cooperative
dance. That dance is a sketch of something that is inside a
person, and not fully revealed by the words alone. I came
to realize that if I were able to record part of the dance‚Äî
that is, the spoken part‚Äî and reenact it, the rest of the
body would follow. I could then create the illusion of being
another person by reenacting something she had said as she
had said it. My grandfather‚Äôs idea led me to consider that
the reenactment, or the reiteration, of a person‚Äôs words
would also teach me about that person.
I had been trained in the tradition of acting called
‚Äúpsychological realism.‚Äù A basic tenet of psychological
realism is that characters live inside of you and that you
create a lifelike portrayal of the character through a process
of realizing your own similarity to the character. When I

later became a teacher of acting, I began to become more
and more troubled by the self-oriented method. I began to
look for ways to engage my students in putting themselves
in other people‚Äôs shoes. This went against the grain of the
psychological realism tradition, which was to get the character to walk in the actor‚Äôs shoes. It became less and less
interesting intellectually to bring the dramatic literature of
the world into a classroom of people in their late teens and
twenties, and to explore it within the framework of their
real lives. Aesthetically it seemed limited, because most
of the time the characters all sounded the same. Most characters spoke somewhere inside the rhythmic range of the
students. More troubling was that this method left an
important bridge out of acting. The spirit of acting is the
travel from the self to the other. This ‚Äúself-based‚Äù method
seemed to come to a spiritual halt. It saw the self as the
ultimate home of the character. To me, the search for character is constantly in motion. It is a quest that moves back
and forth between the self and the other.
I needed evidence that you could find a character‚Äôs psychological reality by ‚Äúinhabiting‚Äù that character‚Äôs words. I
needed evidence of the limitations of basing a character on
a series of metaphors from an actor‚Äôs real life. I wanted to
develop an alternative to the self-based technique, a technique that would begin with the other and come to the self,
a technique that would empower the other to find the actor
rather than the other way around.
